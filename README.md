# First Challenge â€“ QR Code Component

Download Starter Files: The challenge includes pre-written HTML and CSS starter code, simulating a real-world project handoff. Download these files.
Download Figma Design File: Open the design in Figma to inspect elements as needed.
Review Documentation: Read through the README.md and style-guide.md files for design details, colors, and fonts.
Implementation: Open the starter code in VS Code, inspect the Figma file, and start implementing the design.

# Reflection

1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
- Figma was a good reference but the style-guide.md seemed to be more useful because of the exact values. 

2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
- I used flexbox to align my main content. Had issues with the img overlapping, but soloved that issue with setting width to 375px and adding  border-radius of 15px.

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
- Feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor can help me see how other people approach this challenge differently. This can help me understand different ways to write a cleaner code.
